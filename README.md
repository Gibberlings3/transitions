This mod requires EET, BG1EE, SoD, or BG2EE.

The Transitions mod's main purpose is to provide seemless transitions between campaigns in EET.  It will  provide a mechanism to remain in the BGI "world" after Sarevok is defeated and BG2 "world" after Irenicus is defeated.  It also allows for skipping ahead to BG2 (when present), skipping all or the remainder of SoD (when present), as suits the player.

Progressing through to SoD or BGII areas of the game is accomplished by using a custom item provided by Duke Belt after the clean-up quests are finished or skipped.  Progressing through to ToB is accomplished by using the Amulet of Selderine provided by Queen Ellesmine.

After Sarevok has been defeated, the protagonist can take up residence at the Ducal Palace, thanks to Duke Belt.  If the protagonist rescued Duke Eltan, he will show his appreciation by awarding the keys to a home.  There is also the possibility for a number of new clean-up quests, depending upon which of Sarevok's followers have been previously eliminated.  BGI and TotSC quests can be finished after Sarevok's death, giving the player control over the order of events.

In order to plug the plot hole dealing with Sarevok's sword, he can be given his equipment, either equipped or just in his inventory, so that it can be looted and confiscated after his death.  If you choose to equip his items, the final fight with him might be slightly more difficult.

There is an option for a new bhaal-spawn ability that will be added during the first rest period after defeating Sarevok.  Good and neutral aligned protagonists will receive the equivalent of Greenstone Amulet's Mind Shield, evil receives Algernon's Cloak Charm Creature.
