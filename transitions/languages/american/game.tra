@1027 = ~(This journal spans the last six months. Certain entries strike you as being important.)

S. and I had a long talk last night. Everything he says makes so much sense. I offered him my family crypt to use as a safehouse, and he accepted. The old motifs to the Dead Three seem particularly appropriate now. I often meditate by the symbol of Bhaal and think on his teachings, and on how his influence is returning to the land.

...

Today, S. mentioned that his plans are progressing quickly. He'll be gone for a week or two conducting research in an old tomb somewhere near Bridgefort. I lack his leadership capabilities, but I should be able to manage the followers while he's gone

...

Last night, S. told me the groundwork has been laid for the next phase of his plan. He's moving into new quarters in the Iron Throne. I'll miss our talks, but I'm glad he's gaining the recognition he deserves. He'll change the face of the Sword Coast when he claims his birthright. All will know the power of Bhaal through him.

...

Received word that S. has been killed. I can scarcely believe it. I didn't think anyone could bring about his end. I don't know what to do next. For now, I'll keep the followers safe and stay away from the Flaming Fist.

...

The Flaming Fist is making it impossible to leave the city. There are guards at every gate thanks to their hunt for S. supporters. A hooded figure contacted me yesterday and offered a large sum of money if I could steal Sarevok's sword and deliver it to his agents in Athkatla. The money could be enough to bribe our way out of the city. I agreed. I had little choice.

...

With the help of my allies, we've stolen Sarevok's sword from the Ducal Palace. I wish I could keep it myself, but its sale will fund the safe escape of me and the others. Must be careful in how we store the blade for its trip to Waukeen's Promenade in Athkatla. Apparently, it's no good if the blood's wiped off.~

// Imoen's custom wand of magic missiles
@1036	= ~Imoen's Wand of Magic Missiles~
@1037	= ~This wand looks like an ordinary wand of Magic Missiles, but there's something just a little different about it.  When activated, the wand will eject up to three missiles of magical energy that dart forth and unerringly strike their target. This includes enemy creatures in a melee. The target creature must be seen or otherwise detected to be hit, however, so near-total concealment, such as that offered by arrow slits, can render the spell ineffective. Each missile will inflict 1d4+1 points of damage.

STATISTICS:

Charge abilities:
â€“ Up to 3 magic missiles will strike the target
  Damage: 1d4+1
  Range: 100 ft.
  Area of Effect: 1 creature

@1042	= ~Korlasz is defeated, and the last of Sarevok's influence died with her. Your foster father, Gorion, has been avenged. All those who helped you thwart your half-brother's schemes drift away from you, returning to their lives. Even Imoen is busy, for the most part, with her magical studies with Grand Duke Liia Jannath.  For the first time since you left Candlekeep, you have the opportunity to reflect on the astonishing turns your life has taken.

Though you are feted by the rulers of Baldur's Gate, a sense of unease plagues you. You can't help but hear the rumors, the whispers that you share the same dark blood as Sarevok. Some hint you killed your half-brother not for the good of the city, but so you could usurp his place and his power. For the moment, however, your persecutors' voices are drowned out by an ever-growing number of others with more immediate concerns.

Every day, more refugees driven from their homes by the servants of Caelar Argent arrive at the city gates. Many have stories of the Shining Lady's grace; all have tales of her followers' wrath.

A tenday after you've settled into what would seem a normal life, you enter the Ducal Palace to check up on your friend Imoen, your thoughts troubled. You wonder what effect Caelar's crusade will have on her, you, and Baldur's Gate, little knowing how close at hand the answer is...~

The blade of Sarevok, brother of <CHARNAME>, used in the battle they fought in faraway Baldur's Gate. <CHARNAME> prevailed, destroying Sarevok's plans and rescuing the Sword Coast from the brink of war.
