Description = The Transitions mod's main purpose is to provide seemless transitions between campaigns.  It will provide a mechanism to remain in the BGI "world" after Sarevok is defeated and BG2 "world" after Irenicus is defeated.  It also allows for skipping ahead to BG2, skipping all or the remainder of SoD, as suits the player.

Progressing through to SoD or BGII areas of the game is accomplished by talking to Duke Belt inside the Palace and/or by using a custom item he provides after the clean-up quests are finished.  Progressing through to ToB is accomplished by using the Amulet of Selderine provided by Queen Ellesmine.

After Sarevok has been defeated, the protagonist can take up residence at the Ducal Palace, thanks to Duke Belt.  If the protagonist rescued Duke Eltan, he will show his appreciation by awarding the keys to a home.  There is also the possibility for a number of new clean-up quests, depending upon which of Sarevok's followers have been previously eliminated.  BGI and TotSC quests can be finished after Sarevok's death, giving the player control over the order of events.

There are also options for Sarevok's equipment, Imoen's ability to cast magic missile, as well as a new Bhaalspawn power.

After Irenicus has been dealth with, the protagonist can regain their Bhaalspawn powers and continue with BG2 quests in a more leisurely fashion.
